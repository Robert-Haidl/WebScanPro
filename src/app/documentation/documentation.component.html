<h2>List of headers which WebScanPro scans:</h2>
<h3>Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)</h3>
<p>The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) lets a website tell browsers that it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP.</p>

<h3>X-XSS-Protection</h3>
<p>Browser stops loading the page if it detects reflected XSS<br>
    Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) that disables the use of inline JavaScript.<br>
    Do not set this header or explicitly turn it off.
    </p>

<h3>X-Content-Type-Options</h3>
<p>Blocks mime type sniffing and should be set as followed:</p>
<code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code>

<h3>Referrer-Policy</h3>
<p>Referrer policy has been supported by browsers since 2014. Today, the default behavior in modern browsers is to no longer send all referrer information (origin, path, and query string) to the same site but to only send the origin to other sites. However, since not all users may be using the latest browsers it is suggested forcing this behavior by sending this header on all responses.</p>

<h3>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP)</h3>
<p>The HTTP Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) response header allows you to ensure a top-level document does not share a browsing context group with cross-origin documents.
    This header works together with Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) and Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP) explained below.
    This mechanism protects against attacks like Spectre which can cross the security boundary established by Same Origin Policy (SOP) for resources in the same browsing context group.
    </p>

<h3>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP)</h3>
<p>The HTTP Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) response header prevents a document from loading any cross-origin resources that don't explicitly grant the document permission (using CORP or CORS).
    A document can only load resources from the same origin, or resources explicitly marked as loadable from another origin.
    </p>

<h3>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP)</h3>
<p>The Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP) header allows you to control the set of origins that are empowered to include a resource. It is a robust defense against attacks like Spectre, as it allows browsers to block a given response before it enters an attacker's process.</p>

<h3>Permissions-Policy (formerly Feature-Policy)</h3>
<p>Permissions-Policy allows you to control which origins can use which browser features, both in the top-level page and in embedded frames. For every feature controlled by Feature Policy, the feature is only enabled in the current document or frame if its origin matches the allowed list of origins. This means that you can configure your site to never allow the camera or microphone to be activated. This prevents that an injection, for example an XSS, enables the camera, the microphone, or other browser feature.
    <code>Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), camera=(), microphone=()</code>
    This example is disabling geolocation, camera and microphne on all domains.
    </p>

    <h3>X-Powered-By</h3>
    <p>The X-Powered-By header describes the technologies used by the webserver. This information exposes the server to attackers. Using the information in this header, attackers can find vulnerabilities easier.</p>

    <h2>TLS/SSL Versions</h2>
    <h3>TLS 1.3</h3>
    <p>TLS 1.3 is the latest and most secure version of the TLS protocol. It offers improved security, faster handshake, and enhanced privacy features.<br>It is strongly recommended to use TLS 1.3 for the highest level of security.</p>

    <h3>TLS 1.2</h3>
    <p>TLS 1.2 is a widely adopted and secure version of the TLS protocol. It provides strong encryption and security features. While not the latest version, it is still considered secure and is widely supported.<br>But an update to Version 1.3 is recommended.</p>

    <h3>TLS 1.1</h3>
    <p>TLS 1.1 is outdated and has known vulnerabilities. It is generally not recommended to use TLS 1.1 due to security concerns.<br>Upgrading to a newer version, preferably TLS 1.3, is highly recommended.</p>

    <h3>TLS 1.0</h3>
    <p>TLS 1.0 is outdated and has significant security vulnerabilities.<br>Upgrading to a newer version, preferably TLS 1.3, is highly recommended.</p>

    <h3>SSL Version 3</h3>
    <p>SSLv3 is obsolete and has serious security flaws, including the POODLE vulnerability.<br>Upgrading to a newer version, preferably TLS 1.3, is highly recommended.</p>

    <h3>SSL Version 2</h3>
    <p>SSLv2 is extremely outdated and insecure, with numerous vulnerabilities. Its use is strongly discouraged, and modern systems no longer support it.<br>Upgrading to a newer version, preferably TLS 1.3, is highly recommended.</p>
